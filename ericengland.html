        <h1>Titans of Computer History</h1>
            
            <h2>Charles Babbage: the Father of Computers</h2>
                
                <h3>Time Period:</h3>
        
                    <p>Charles Babbage birthplace and even the exact date appear to be disputed, as his obituary stated he was born in 1792, though a letter from his nephew and a baptism record seems to indicate that he was born one year earlier in 1791. The youngest in a family with four children, he almost perished at the hands of a fever at the age of 8 years old.</p>
                
                    <p>When Babbage attended Holmwood Academy as a young boy, he discovered a love of mathematics, which helped propel him to Cambridge, though he was so proficiently self-taught, he was actually disappointed with the level of mathematical teachings at the college. He was the top mathematician at his school, though he did not graduate with honors, which may be due to him defended a heavily controversial thesis in the preliminary public disputation.</p>
                
                    <p>Babbage is more specifically known for his designs on the difference engine, and later on the analytical engine that he designed by improving upon his first design. If completed, it would have had storage, conditional control, and it would be able to read instructions from punch cards. If Babbage had had the funding to complete his machine, it would have propelled computer science forward 100 years.</p>
                
                <h3>Historical Impact:</h3>
            
                    <p>Charles Babbage’s designs for the analytical engine heavily inspired several other titans of computer history, such as Howard Aiken and his Harvard Mark I Calculating Machine. He also worked very closely with Ada Lovelace, who wrote an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli numbers, which was designed to work in conjunction with Babbage’s analytical machine. Though he unfortunately never fully completed his work, he played around with the idea, perfecting it where he could, until he died in 1871. His work has named him a pioneer of computing, and can even place him as the “father of computers”.</p>

                    <p>Babbage designed one of the first computers, an idea that people are still building on today. Not only did his introduction of the punch cards to mechanical computing give us the basis of modern computation, it also introduced several features never seen before like sequential control, branching, and looping. If completed, his machine would have been the first to be “Turing-complete”, which means that it could be used to simulate a Turing machine. His designs are still being built today, though more for public engagement than any actual utility.</p>

                    <p>One suspected reason that Babbage may have never been able to complete his machines was because he was generally an insufferable person to be around. Several causes that he crusaded against were street music (especially organ grinders), broken windows, and even a good ole-fashioned game of stick-hoop.</p>

            <h2>Ada Lovelace: The First Programmer</h2>
            
                <h3>Time Period:</h3>
                
                    <p>Ada Lovelace became well known after she translated Luigi Menabrea’s article on Babbage’s Analytical Engine. She appended a set of notes at the bottom that would become famous in the world of computing. Ada Lovelace’s spent 9 months translating this article, between the years of 1842 and 1843. She included many things, some being how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. Also included in her notes is that the analytical engine is not the start of AI. </p>
                
                <h3>Historical Impact:</h3>
                
                    <p>Lovelace writes in her notes, what comes to be the first programming language. She writes in note “G” an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. This is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specified for a computer. Sadly the engine was never completed so her program was never tested.</p>

                    <p>Lovelace is relevant in today’s world for many reasons. Like many other computer engineers, when something is invented, it helps the overall growth of computer science reach heights it couldn’t before. Lovelace contributed to this by simply writing notes on an article. If it wasn’t for her to do her part, who knows where we would be in today’s world with computers.</p>
                
                <h3>Extra:</h3>
                
                    <p>The notes are actually longer than the article itself. Ada Lovelace Day is an international holiday to celebrate the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering, and math. It is observed on the second Tuesday of October.</p>

            <h2>Grace Hopper: The Legacy of the Bug and Computing Standards</h2>
            
                <h3>Time Period:</h3>
                
                    <p>Grace Hopper was a very innovative computer scientist for her time.  She was born in 1906 in New York City and at an early age showed an interest in how things worked.  She received PHD in Mathematics at Yale University and then went on to teaching Mathematics at Vassar College.  In 1944, at the age of 37, she enlisted in the Navy Reserves during World War II, where she started working with computers and retired in 1986 when she retired a highly accomplished Navy Admiral and a very long legacy in computer science. She died on January 1st, 1992 in Arlington, Virginia.</p>
                    
                <h3>Historical Impact:</h3>
                
                    <p>Hopper’s life successes were many.  She was part of the team that worked on the UNIVAC Computer, one of the first computers. She was also famous for inventing one of the first linkers that helped develop COBOL (one of the first programing languages) that is still in use today.  She also played a part in developing the standards to test computer systems, components, and languages, that we use today.  She received many awards and recognition through career, including the USS Hopper aircraft carrier was named after her, and she earned the defense Distinguished Service Medal Award, and today we celebrate her life work through a yearly conference called Grace Hopper celebration that helps future women in technology.</p>

                    <p>Hopper is well known, in the computer realm for being the creator of the term “debugging”. Debugging as we know it today is the process of finding and resolving bugs in computer systems.  In 1947, while working on the Mark II computer, she found there was a problem with one,  when moth had gotten stuck in one of the computer relays, and there for they had to “debug” the computer.  The moth can be seen on display in the Smithsonian Museum to this day.   The term bug had been synonymously with problem for at least century before, however Hopper may have been the first ones to use it in Computer Science or at least influence others to use it. </p>
